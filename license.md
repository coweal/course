The goal of the Practical Community Management project is to create an open learning center for community practitioners, so anyone can educate themselves to build better online communities. I encourage companies to send their community managers, moderators and volunteers to this course. Everyone is very welcome to share the link to this course with their colleagues and friends. The course is totally free for everyone. You can also freely quote ideas from the course if you find them interesting (please do not forget to attribute the quote with the back link to the course.)

What is not okay is to save, replicate or redistribute a significant part of the course publicly or privately. If you want to have this course adapted for internal use of your company or community, please contact me and I will license the materials for you, adjust it for your unique case and help create quizzes.

If you have any questions, suggestions or feedback, please feel free to send me an email at [nicolas.chabanovsky@gmail.com](mailto:nicolas.chabanovsky@gmail.com)
