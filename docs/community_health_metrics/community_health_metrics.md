"If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it." Most of us know this perfectly and a complete lack of metrics is rarely an issue today. The main problems nowadays are which metrics to use and how to interpret them in situations where there are a lot of metrics and some of them show growth, but others show a decline, or when the metrics don't show any change, but clearly there are enormous changes underway.
