# Community as a product

Community - people and the relationships between them - is a product in itself. The value (sense of belonging, feeling of unity, etc) that the “consumers” (the users) get from the “product” (the community) usually lies outside the physical world. The goal of a community manager is to maximize this value. To do this, the community manager needs to properly configure three key components of the system: the mission, the tools, and the rules.
